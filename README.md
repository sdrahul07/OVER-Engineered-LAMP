# 💡 Overengineered Lamp  
*A radical reinterpretation of ambient lighting.*  
**By Rahul Deshpande**

Built purely from 3D-printed parts and designed with unapologetic complexity, the **Overengineered Lamp** is a kinetic sculpture that blurs the lines between utility and artistry.

---

## 🌀 Overview

This project embodies an experimental approach to design and fabrication, fusing parametric aesthetics with practical illumination. The structure is a cylindrical framework adorned with multiple interleaved angular light diffusers, strategically arranged for dramatic refraction and shadowplay.

It’s a conversation piece—an engineering flex—and yes, it lights up too.

## ✨ Features

- **100% 3D Printed**  
  All structural components are manufactured using FDM 3D printing with standard filament materials (PLA, PETG, etc.).

- **Modular Assembly**  
  Designed with toleranced joints for easy disassembly, upgrades, or color customization.

- **Radial Symmetry with Intentional Chaos**  
  Angled translucent fins rotate around a central axis, diffusing light in unpredictable and beautiful ways.

- **Cable Channeling & Mounting**  
  Hidden channels for clean wiring and optional mounts for desk, ceiling, or wall installation.

- **Customizable Core**  
  Can house various lighting modules (LED ring, RGB strip, or smart bulb).

## 🧩 Assembly Instructions

1. **Print all parts** using recommended settings (0.2mm layer height, 15–20% infill)(100% for fins).  
2. **Insert diffuser fins** into slotted guides on the bottom ring.  
3. **Add inverted fins** between the first set to create interleaved layering.  
4. **Place the inner diffuser cylinder** into the center to align the structure.  
5. **Attach the top ring** (press-fit or glue if needed).  
6. **Install the light module** inside the cavity.  
7. **Cap with the top ring lid** (glue recommended for a tight fit).  

📎 A detailed visual guide is available in the `Images/` folder or the included poster.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This lamp is a manifestation of **function following form**—intentionally overcomplicated to provoke thought, spark conversation, and serve as an expression of design indulgence.

It’s for makers who appreciate:
- Absurd levels of detail  
- Symmetrical chaos  
- The joy of creating something beautifully unnecessary
